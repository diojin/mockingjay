## Why called mockingjay
As you may remember the movie series **"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay"**, although with not high rating, I feel it quite interesting and like it very much.  Its plot, its metaphor, always make me feel, sometimes, one has to be irony and skeptical of what is being so assured, and take some actions. 

Some web pages to share, if you'd be interested in it, [The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2] or [another page]
